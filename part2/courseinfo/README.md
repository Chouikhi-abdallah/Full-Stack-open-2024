# Course Info Application

This project is part of the Full Stack Open 2024 curriculum. It is designed to display course information in a structured format, demonstrating the use of React components and props.

## Features

- **Display Course Information**: Shows detailed information about different courses including their name, parts, and exercises.
- **Modular Components**: The application is built using multiple React components that manage different aspects of the course data.

## Project Structure

Hereâ€™s how the project is organized:

- `src/`: This directory houses all React components used to build the application.
- `src/App.js`: The central React component that aggregates other components.
- `src/index.js`: Entry point for the React application that renders the `App` component.
- `public/`: Contains static assets like the HTML template file.
